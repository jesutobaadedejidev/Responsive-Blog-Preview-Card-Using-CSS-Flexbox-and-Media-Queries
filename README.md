## My process

I started with writing my markup i.e structuring the preview card with HTML. Then I went on to add the styles to the preview card from top to bottom. I thne used media qqueries to make the page responsive on all devices.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Media Queries
- Mobile-first workflow

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

I solidified my knowledge of media queries and adding external fonts to my code.

```css
.proud-of-this-css @font-face {
  font-family: "my-font";
  src: url("./assets/fonts/Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf");
}
```

### Continued development

CSS Animations
